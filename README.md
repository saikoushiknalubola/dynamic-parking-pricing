# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots  
**Summer Analytics 2025 ‚Äì Capstone Project**  
**Organized by the Consulting & Analytics Club √ó Pathway**

---

## üìò Overview

Urban parking lots often suffer from inefficiencies due to static pricing systems. This project implements a **real-time, data-driven dynamic pricing system** that adjusts parking fees based on current demand, vehicle flow, and other contextual factors.

The system is built using only the permitted libraries: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Pathway**, and **Bokeh**, and adheres to all constraints in the problem statement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion

* Read dataset (`dataset.csv`)
* Merge timestamp columns
* Simulate streaming using `Pathway.replay_csv()`

### 2. Feature Engineering

* Occupancy ratio
* Queue length (based on occupancy)
* Traffic congestion (simulated)
* Special day indicator
* Vehicle type weight

### 3. Model Implementations

#### ‚úÖ Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing

A simple linear pricing strategy:

```
Price = Base Price + Œ± * (Occupancy / Capacity)
```

#### ‚úÖ Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

Uses multiple features to calculate demand:

```
Demand = 0.6*(Occupancy/Capacity) + 
         0.2*Queue - 
         0.1*Traffic + 
         0.1*SpecialDay + 
         0.05*VehicleWeight
```

The demand is normalized and mapped to a price between **\$5** and **\$20**:

```
Price = Base * (1 + 0.5 * Normalized Demand)
```

#### üîÑ Model 3: Competitive Pricing Strategy *(Conceptual)*

* Detects nearby lots using lat-long
* Compares competitor prices
* Adjusts price or reroutes vehicle based on occupancy and pricing
* Not implemented due to single-location dataset

## üìä Visualization

Interactive, real-time pricing plots are generated using **Bokeh** and displayed with **Panel** in Google Colab. These help visualize:

* Time series of dynamic prices
* Model behavior under real-time conditions

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-parking-pricing.git
```

2. **Open the notebook** in Google Colab:

   * File: `notebook/final_notebook.ipynb`

3. **Upload the dataset** when prompted:

   * File: `data/dataset.csv`

4. **Run all cells sequentially**:

   * This will simulate real-time streaming and display dynamic pricing plots

## üìù Report (Optional)

A PDF report detailing the methodology, model assumptions, and observations is available at:

```
report/Dynamic_Pricing_Report.pdf
```
