# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots  
**Summer Analytics 2025 ‚Äì Capstone Project**  
**Organized by the Consulting & Analytics Club √ó Pathway**

---

## üìò Overview

Urban parking lots often suffer from inefficient utilization due to static pricing systems. This project implements a real-time, data-driven dynamic pricing engine using Python to dynamically adjust parking fees based on occupancy, traffic conditions, vehicle type, and special events.

The goal is to build a pricing model that updates in real-time using only **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Pathway**, and **Bokeh**, as per the constraints of the problem statement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Load and preprocess the `dataset.csv` file.
- Merge date and time columns into a unified timestamp.
- Sort by time and stream data using `Pathway.replay_csv()`.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Occupancy rate
- Queue length (simulated from occupancy)
- Traffic congestion (simulated)
- Special event indicator
- Vehicle type weight (inferred)

### 3. Model Implementations

#### Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
A simple linear pricing model:
```
Price = Base Price + Œ± * (Occupancy / Capacity)
```

#### Model 2: Demand-Based Dynamic Pricing
A weighted feature-driven pricing model:
```
Demand = 0.6*(Occupancy/Capacity) + 
         0.2*Queue Length - 
         0.1*Traffic + 
         0.1*Special Day + 
         0.05*Vehicle Type Weight

Price = Base Price * (1 + Œª * Normalized Demand)
```
Price is bounded between $5 and $20.

#### Model 3: Competitive Pricing Strategy (Conceptual)
- Detect nearby lots using location data
- Compare competitor prices
- Suggest rerouting or adjust pricing
- *Not implemented due to single-location dataset*

## üìä Visualization

Real-time plots are generated using **Bokeh** inside Google Colab.  
Features:
- Time-series line plots of pricing over time
- Interactive dashboards with real-time updates
